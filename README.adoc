= Supply Chain demo

Build this Docker Image in OpenShift which will create an ImageStream. Then use this ImageStream as a Builder for a Wildfly project.

Then "patch" this image and force a rebuild of the builder, which will then force a change of the final built image.

Not likely to be used in production but shows the potential power of what you can automate.
